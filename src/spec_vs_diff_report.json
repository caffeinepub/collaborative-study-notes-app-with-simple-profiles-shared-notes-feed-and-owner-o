  "summary": "REQ-60 is partially implemented by adding a FeedBackground wrapper with a fixed background image layer and a theme-aware overlay/blur for readability. However, the diff does not show the actual JPEG being added as a static asset, and there are several unrelated UI/theme changes (not requested) that likely affect non-feed screens and user-facing text.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-60",
      "requirement": "Add the image file \"WhatsApp Image 2026-02-09 at 8.24.07 PM.jpeg\" to the frontend as a static asset (not served from the backend) and use it as the background on the authenticated NotesFeed screen.",
      "reason": "FeedBackground references an asset URL, but the diff summary does not show the JPEG file being added anywhere under a static assets directory (e.g., frontend/public/assets). Without the file present, the background will not load.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/FeedBackground.tsx (references url(/assets/WhatsApp%20Image%202026-02-09%20at%208.24.07%20PM.jpeg))",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Login screen content/marketing copy and UI layout changes (e.g., StudyNotes title, feature cards like Collaborate/Organize, gradient background).",
      "reason": "REQ-60 only asks to set a background image behind the authenticated NotesFeed screen and explicitly says other non-feed screens (e.g., login) should keep their existing appearance; this introduces new user-facing text and likely alters the login screen.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (LoginScreen shows new headings and paragraphs such as \"StudyNotes\", \"Collaborate with students...\", and feature cards)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "New global visual theme changes (warm academic theme tokens, OKLCH palette adjustments) beyond the feed background overlay.",
      "reason": "REQ-60 does not request theme/token changes; it only requests a background image + overlay/blur for feed readability. Changing global CSS variables affects the whole app (including non-feed screens).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (many :root and .dark token changes, not limited to feed background)",
        "frontend/src/index.css (comments: \"Warm academic theme - amber/orange accents\")"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "New error boundary UI with user-facing text (e.g., \"Something went wrong\", \"Reload Page\").",
      "reason": "REQ-60 does not request adding/changing error handling UI; also violates the constraint of no user-facing text changes introduced as part of this request.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (ErrorBoundary render includes \"Something went wrong\", \"An unexpected error occurred\", \"Reload Page\")"
